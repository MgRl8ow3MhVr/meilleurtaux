## Description

This is a fullstack simplified version of www.meilleurtaux.com, a french website that gives you quotes for loans.

A cookie and a React state help you save the datas you entered even if you close the tab. You will automatically come back to where you left the form.

I added a few sounds for the fun, and a back-office with a very ... "modern" design with a random color generator ;)
The percentage bar and its turning wheel are CSS home made !

## Technologies

### Frontend

React, CSS, Axios, the Vipoco API is used to propose ZipCodes, js-cookie

### Backend

the back-end is in an independant repo.
Node.js, express, mongoDB, MailGun
